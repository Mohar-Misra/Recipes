            Stuffed Eggplant Ingredients
            These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this restaurant-worthy stuffed eggplant recipe at home: 

            Eggplant: You’ll need one eggplant (halved lengthwise) to make two servings. 
            Olive oil: Brush the shells with olive oil before seasoning with salt and pepper. 
            Seasonings: This stuffed eggplant is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and fresh basil. 
            Sausage: Sweet Italian sausage makes this stuffed eggplant a hearty, crowd-pleasing meal. 
            Vegetables: An onion and fresh mushrooms lend texture and flavor. 
            Pasta sauce: Use store-bought or homemade tomato-basil pasta sauce. 
            Bread crumbs: Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs give the stuffed eggplant a welcome crunch. 
            Cheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese instead of using the pre-shredded stuff.
